Read Me


In this assignment, which was very difficult, I learned how to get an API key, use it to access api, and ask questions of two json data sets.


I also learned how to hide an API key, how to commit to GitHub via Visual Studio, and the limits of using a chromebook for developers.


Even though I did not get all the answers to the LastFM problem set, I feel I truly began to understand programming.
